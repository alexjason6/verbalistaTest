# Verbalista APP - Test

While developing the app, I did some quick, superficial research into whether it would be better to type or select the correct word. Although typing is apparently better for learning, I believe that lively interaction can help the user not get bored. That's why I chose screen B.

I decided to use TypeScript to make everything more concise and easier to read. Additionally, as I usually do, I used Styled Components to style the application.

Since I have no experience with animation, it was a challenge to make it work and that's a good thing. I always like to progress. It was also a challenge to understand DropArea and how to use it.
